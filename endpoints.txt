These are the methods used for the endpoints

The API identifies the following items
    - user
    - course
    - student
    - instructor
In this readme file, "identifier" is used in place of any of these

That is to say, you would have to use something like /api/identifier to make requests

| GET REQUESTS
To get all details from any of the above items, use the GET method and the url should be in the following format
    /api/identifier

To get a specific item, use /api/identifier/key
For the case of students, you can use /api/student/id or /api/student/index_number and it would work


| POST REQUESTS
Use "POST REQUESTS" to create an item. It uses the endpoint format
    /api/identifier/


| PATCH REQUESTS
Use the "PATCH REQUEST" to update an item. It goes in the endpoint format /api/identifier/key


| DELETE REQUESTS
Use the "DELETE REQUEST" method to delete an item from the table. It goes with the endpoint format /api/identifier/key


Responses are received in the format
{
        "success": bool,
        "results": array|string|bool,
        "message": string
}
