These are the methods used for the endpoints

The API identifies the following items
    - user
    - course
    - student
    - instructor
    - program
    - quiz
    - question
    - questionoptions
In this readme file, "identifier" is used in place of any of these

That is to say, you would have to use something like /api/identifier to make requests

| GET REQUESTS
To get all details from any of the above items, use the GET method and the url should be in the following format
    /api/identifier
You can also get specific resourses. For example, you can get the questions from a specific quiz using the url format below
    /api/quiz/1/questions
There are some specific classes which have relations with other classes, and the associated array below defines it
    [
        "user" => ["courses"],
        "quiz" => ["instructor", "course", "program", "questions"],
        "student" => ["courses", "program"],
        "question" => [],
        "questionoption" => ["question"],
        "program" => [],
        "course" => ["instructor", "program"],
        "instructor" => ["courses"]
    ]
usage: /api/identifier/id/method
* NB: This approach is only available in the get requests alone. Other request methods are disallowed 

To get a specific item, use /api/identifier/key
For the case of students, you can use /api/student/id or /api/student/index_number and it would work


| POST REQUESTS
Use "POST REQUESTS" to create an item. It uses the endpoint format
    /api/identifier/


| PATCH REQUESTS
Use the "PATCH REQUEST" to update an item. It goes in the endpoint format /api/identifier/key


| DELETE REQUESTS
Use the "DELETE REQUEST" method to delete an item from the table. It goes with the endpoint format /api/identifier/key


Responses are received in the format
{
        "success": bool,
        "results": array|string|bool,
        "message": string
}
